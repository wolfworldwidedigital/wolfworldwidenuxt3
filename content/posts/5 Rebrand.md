# Rebrand

A new rebrand for Wolf Worldwide and David.
Get ready for some new, innovative concepts and apps.

## Design

I went for a new color scheme, to look more neon, and glowy.

I've redesigned the website to make it more unique, inspired by HQLauncher.

And I've picked out some new fonts, to look more bold I went with Hanson for headings, and Outfit for body text.

I spent some time making a promotion video in After Effects for this rebrand. Check it out:

I also spend quite a bit of time making this interior in Blender for a 1 second part in the video, so I thought I would share it more:
