Introducing a whole new Bing. With a new simplistic home page, and dark mode search page, and a Bing AI Chat redesign. You can generate text, images, code, and audio with the new Bing AI. And interact with it better, with a new right panel where you can access your recent chats, and trending topics.

This is not real software. This is a concept, made in Figma and After Effects by me. I am not affiliated with Microsoft.
